## Chateau dans le ciel

## Prerequisites

- `nodejs` version: latest
- `npm` version: latest

```
npm install
```
## Subject

See chateaudansleciel-fr.pdf

## run test

```
npm test
```

## Challenge

This nodejs code is not efficient. We have no response (not before hours) for test3 :-) 
The idea is to improve the algorithm so that it will pass test3 in less than one second.
Thanks for your PR if you find the solution before me.
